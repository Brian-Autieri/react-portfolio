## Description

The purpose of the project was a to create a portfolio using React. The portfolio includes a header, a navbar and footer. The navbar consists of links to the Portfolio, About, Resume and Contact pages. The Portfolio page includes a list of projects with links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository. The About page includes a short bio and a photo. The Resume page includes a list of skills and proficiencies, along with a PDF file of a resume. The Contact page includes a form to send an email.

## Usage

The application is deployed on GitHub Pages. The user can navigate to the Portfolio, About, Resume and Contact pages using the navbar. The user can click on the links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository for each project. The user can also click on the email link to send an email.

## Installation

Clone the repository from GitHub. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Run `npm start` to start the application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
